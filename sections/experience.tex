% EXPERIENCE A
%====================
\subsection{{Independent Education Technology Developer \hfill May 2020 --- Present}}
\subtext{Supported Via University Fellowship \hfill Chicago, IL \& Chico, CA}
\begin{zitemize}
\item Prototype: \skills{Unity} enhancements of a graphical young adult biology book with emphasis on physical dynamic interactions from user to change the AR environment, using \skills{C\# and Android SDK}
\item International Conference of Learning Sciences \skills{\LaTeX} template --- source cloned and used in a project to create a pipeline using \skills{RMarkDown} for scholars with disabilities with respect to ease of access to professional typesetting tools.
\item Created training and discussions for PhD students on version control as it connects to organizational memory and learning
\item Created a simple, accessible, and automated system for in-game raffles for a MMORPG using MySQL queries and Google Sheets
\end{zitemize}

% EXPERIENCE B
%====================

\subsection{Project: Computational Verification of the Cone Conjecture \hfill	August 2016 â€” May 2019}
\subtext{Mathematics Master's Thesis, San Francisco State University \hfill San Francisco, CA}
\begin{zitemize}
\item Created iterative algorithms in \skills{Python} to study polyhedral cones over higher dimensional lattice vector spaces. \item The work directly relates to integer \skills{mathematical optimization} (understanding feasible regions)
\item Implemented two iterative algorithms that can be applied to any finite dimensions applying the same branch of linear algebra behind search engine ranking and gradient descent in artificial intelligence
\item Automated the typesetting of data by creating a \LaTeX template and scripting the creation of files using Python
\item Used modern programming techniques including an object-oriented approach for data structures, and unit testing
\item Implemented version control using \href{https://github.com/TimmyChan/ConeThesis}{\bfseries{GitHub}} \end{zitemize}

\subsection{Mathematics Instructor of Record\hfill	Aug 2016 --- May 2019}
\subtext{San Francisco State University \hfill San Francisco, CA}
\begin{zitemize}
\item Independently used data driven techniques to identify students who need additional help
\item \skills{Public Speaking}: Represented SFSU math department as model facilitator for the SF Chronicle
\item Created digital resources for Calculus instructors and students hosted at the Math Department website with \skills{PHP}
\item Created and maintained professional \skills{WordPress} \href{http://www.mathwithtimmy.com}{ educator portfolio}
\end{zitemize}
